            <p>$10 a month. I'd say the cost of a cup of coffee per day .... but more like 1/10th of the cost of Venti Caffe Mocha
                per day. (<em>And yes, I had to look that up</em>)</p>
            
            <h2>The Thought Process</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Please see full disclaimer at end of this post regarding content. The TLDR: Everything here is
                my opinion, I try to be as accurate as possible but I am a human, I make mistakes - please do not use this
                information as a sole source in making business decisions, or any decisions really. Thanks.</p>
            
            <p>It is nearly impossible to listen to a web dev podcast right now and not hear about "AI". In the podcasts I listen to
                those talks inevitable lead to talking about <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">Github's Copilot</a>
                product. Github graciously offers a free trial, as of the time of this writing they offer a 30-day free trial, and
                after hearing both good and bad feedback about the product (<em>mostly good</em>) I decided to give it a go. At the
                end of the trial, I decided to go a different route.</p>
            
            <h2>My environment</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Some context regarding my experiences</strong></p>
            
            <p>I work as a full-time developer for a government agency. I have been developing professionally for a little less than
                a year now, and as a hobby and on the side for about 4 years now. At work I primarily work in PHP, MySQL and SQL as
                well as dabble in AWS Lambda written using Python. Outside of work I am a big believer in the fundamentals of web
                development and using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to accomplish my goals.</p>
            
            <p><em>I have also recently become a <strong>HUGE</strong> fan of AstroJS. Not 100% relevant here maybe - but anytime I
                    can talk good about AstroJS I am going to.</em></p>
            
            <p>Due to nature of the department where I work I am often working on several projects at once and, at times, have to
                swap out my JavaScript brain for my Python brain and then put on my PHP shorts for a swim. Therefore, the thought of
                having "my little coding buddy" that lived in my VSCode was appealing to me.</p>
            
            <h2>My experience with Copilot</h2>
            
            <p>In a nutshell, Copilot is awesome! I could write a comment like:</p>
            
            <pre><code>//Function to evaluate user input that uses Regex
            to ensure it matches the correct format</code></pre>
            
            <p>and then wait a few seconds and am presented with this:</p>
            
            <pre><code>    function  isValidSSN(ssn) {
                    var pattern = /^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$/;
                    return pattern.test(email);
                }</code></pre>
            
            <p>That's pretty cool. Especially given how much I dislike writing Regex because admittedly I just don't know them well
                enough to enjoy it. (<em>By the way I didn't use the code above and have no clue if it is correct - just
                    saying</em>). Now I could just as easily gotten this from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack
                    Overflow,</a> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a>, or a handful of other sites, but this
                is happening in my little VS Code world and I don't need to open a browser window to do it. I don't need to sift
                through several posts and read a bunch of comments about "better" ways to do it .. which for me can be real time
                killer. Once I start clicking on links to "learn more" ... well let's just say I can lose half a day that way.</p>
            
            <p>I also really enjoy the feeling that the code suggestion is created for me specifically. All mine to use until I
                decide to share it with the world.</p>
            
            <p>Then I started to notice that when I stopped to think, or scratch my leg, or take a sip if coffee - that depending on
                where my cursor was Copilot would take that pause as an indication that it was time to suggest code. So, where I may
                have typed</p>
            
            <pre><code>    async function getOrdersByDepartment(dep, status) {
            
                }</code></pre>
            
            <p>and then stopped to scratch my nose Copilot might suggest 15-20 lines of code, based on previous functions in the
                code base I think, that were totally wrong and not relevant to what I was doing. And that's okay, I am not perfect
                so I cannot expect it to be perfect - unless I hit <code>tab</code> or <code>enter</code> in error and inserted the
                code I did not want it's no harm done. And if I hit the wrong key, well that is on me. I did, however, find it to be
                a little disorienting and <em>very</em> distracting. I found myself disabling Copilot when I needed to
                <em>really</em> think through how to approach something. Which is kind of the opposite of what I wanted from my
                Little Coding Buddy.</p>
            
            <p>I will say if I was doing something repetitive, such as looping over an array and returning each value how and where
                I needed it, Copilot was great at suggesting exactly what I needed. It was essentially "autocomplete" for stuff I
                knew - but was just a pain to type out. What I was expecting was something more akin this scenario:</p>
            
            <p>I am looping over an array and returning line after line of</p>
            
            <pre><code>html += '&lt;td&gt;' + data[i].id + '&lt;/td&gt;';</code></pre>
            
            <p>and my little coding buddy would pop up (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Clippy</a>
                maybe from Office) and say "Hey Jon! You're doing great work! And have you lost weight?.... looking good - but also
                if you just did a <code>.map</code> function over that array you could produce more performant code in 35 less lines
                of code. Something like that.</p>
            
            <p>I then started to notice that when Copilot was active I started to feel pressured to not stop typing to avoid the
                code suggestions from popping up. I was literally racing my coding environment and would even feel my pulse increase
                a bit... kind of a weird side effect I guess - but there it is.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, I will say when the code suggestions were relevant to what I was doing, they were spot on and I can
                absolutely say that I was able to code faster overall. I further suspect that if our codebase used React or Vue or
                any kind of framework versus bespoke functions I would probably have seen a lot more value at that start.</p>
            
            <h2><em>So how did CodePen come into this?</em></h2>
            
            <p>Like most of devAmerica I listen to the <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk Show</a> regularly and I am a
                fan of both <a href="https://daverupert.com/">Dave Rupert</a> and <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris
                    Coyier</a>. I have also used <a href="https://codepen.io/jonellwood">CodePen</a> on a free account for several
                years.</p>
            
            <p>I will acknowledge that CodePen and Copilot are two different products, and it might seem odd to be comparing the two
                - but the commonality for me is that my budget only allows for one of them to get my money each month.</p>
            
            <h2>What factors I weighed</h2>
            
            <p>While out for a run one day my mind wandered as it is prone to do during the two hours I am out and about. I starting
                thinking about Copilot and what I liked and what I didn't like. Copilot, for me, was good at auto completing lines
                of code for me - but did not alter the way I wrote code and does not improve what I was writing. Due to the nature
                of the product, I suppose it was good at giving me code that I or someone else wrote, or a variation thereof that
                matched more or less what I was doing. And that is okay, let's be honest, I am not creating anything that hasn't
                already been done in some way. I'm not changing the coding landscape here - I am turning letters, numbers, and
                symbols into text and pictures in a browser. (<em>And having a damn good time doing it</em>) But overall, the value
                Copilot brought was just me typing less - but producing essentially the same product as before.</p>
            
            <p>When I am stuck on something, or I have an idea in my head that is not fully matured, or I have a concept, but I am
                not 100% sure where it needs to go - I head straight to CodePen and look for ideas. And yes, I have lost half a day
                browsing through pens and seeing all the amazing ways other people have solved a similar issue ... <em>and probably
                    20 other cools things as well</em> ... I always find the creativity inspiring. And that, at the end of the day,
                was the deciding factor for me.</p>
            
            <mark>While Copilot could give me code, it never sparked any ideas. It could suggest ways to accomplish what I
                <b><i>thought</i></b> I wanted - but on many an occasion, CodePen has taken a spark of an idea and ignited it into a
                full-fledged feature.</mark>

</div>

<p>Oh, one more thing, and this like all of this post is just my opinion, but if I am going to give money to a company and thereby publicly support them.. CodePen is what, 10-15 people? Maybe more, maybe less - I really don't know and Microsoft has 7,500 + employees? 10,000? I am just saying I think my $10 would go further supporting a smaller developer owned business than a big 'ol Microsoft. Not that either company is going to succeed or fail from my $10 a month mind you - but I feel better about supporting a small business.</p>
