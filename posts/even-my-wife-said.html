      <h2>Trader Joes Meatless Ground is ....</h2>
      <p>
        I tried Trader Joes Meatless Ground and it was, in a <s>word</s> hyphenated-word, super-amazing!
      </p>
      <h3>The TLDR</h3>
      <p>It's good. So good!</p>

      <h3>The Upside</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The texture is very close to actual ground beef. My wife (<em>not a vegan at all</em>) tried it and commented on
          how close the texture was to actual beef.</li>
      
        <li>Like beef, the flavor pallet options are bountiful. I used a Trader Joes Taco Seasoning for this go 'round - but
          set some aside and tried it with just salt and pepper and it was great. I believe this could be used in most any
          recipe in place of beef.</li>
        <li>Much like the other plant based meat replacements I have experienced - one overwhelming difference between this
          and beef is the lack of grease.</li>
        <li>Not putting that grease into my body has had numerous benefits thus far (see my post on <a
            href="/blog/my-poop-post.html">poops</a>).</li>
        <li>Kitchen clean up and dishes is far easier. Without all that grease splatter I am saving money on Dawn dish soap!
        </li>

      </ul>
      <h3>The Downside</h3>
      <b>Well..... lemme think....</b>
      <ul>
        <li> This is a personal one - but Trader Joe's is a good 30-45 min drive, each way, but you can order it online so ...
        </li>
        <li>It is about $4.00 for what equates to one pound of quality ground meat ... less than or the same as what Google just
          told me beef costs as of this writing ...</li>
        <li>Oh! I know! You can not stock your freezer with it to eat in the event of a Zombie Apocalypse; but that is because
          it is "dried, textured pea protein" and can be stored at room temperature according to Trader Joe's website ...</li>
        <li>TODO: Find a downside to appear objective even if there is not one simply to avoid appearing biased.</li>
      </ul>
