    <p>My decision to embrace a lifestyle that opts to not eat any products sourced from animals really came down to just five animals. Me, my wife, and my three kids. I made the decision, 100% based, on my overall health and my desire to live long enough to see all my children grow up to become productive human beings. The fact that it is saving animal lives is a secondary benefit.</p>
  
    <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

    <h3 id="vegan-ˈvēɡən">Vegan (/ˈvēɡən/)</h3>
      <p>veg·an: a person who does not eat any food derived from animals and who <em>typically</em> does not use other animal products.</p>
    <h3>Pescatarian (/ˌpeskəˈterēən/)</h3>
      <p>pes·ca·tar·i·an: a person who does not eat meat but does eat fish.</p>
    <h2> What I am not</h2>
  <h3> I am not a <em>strict</em> vegan.</h3>
    <p>In what ways do I stray from the strict path?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>〰️ I wear leather shoes & have leather car seats</li>
      <li>〰️ I cook meat for my kids and give them milk</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I simply choose not to eat meat or dairy and try like heck to avoid all other foods derived from animals. Yes this includes honey for the 🐝 's sake. I read labels religiously and do my best to eat food with as few ingredients as possible, ingredients I can pronounce, and I trust the &#9419; stamp on packaging.</p>

    <p>I would say I am more like a pescatarian that doesn't eat fish. What's the difference? I like nice shoes and you'll never catch me in Birkenstocks.</p>

  <h3>I am not a sounding board for 1,000,000 reason why I should be a strict vegan either.</h3>

    <p>I respect your thoughts and opinions - and your right to have them - but like my man popeye said 'I 🍠 what I 🍠'</p>

    <p>Also, I don't eat yams.</p>

  <h3>I am not a doctor, dietitian, or nutritionists.</h3>

    <p>Nothing you read here should be considered advice on how to live. I am more than happy to share my experiences, thoughts, and feelings on this topic - but I am not, in any way, qualified to tell you how to live your life.</p>
