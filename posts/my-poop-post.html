<h2><b><mark>WARNING: This post discusses poop. The good, the bad, and the smelly.</mark></b></h2>
<p>Before going to a plant based diet I had frequent heartburn, painful gas in my chest (that one time I thought was a heart attack it was so painful), and diarrhea almost all the time. I tried different OTC medications which may have lessened the symptoms from time to time - but never addressed the issue. I lived like that so long it just became my normal.</p>
  
<p>A plant based diet changed all this for the better.</p>

<h2>Obligatory Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I am not a doctor. I don't mean that in the funny way like at the end of Brooklyn 911. I'm really not. This is an account of my experience - like poop - yours may vary.</p>

<h2>Bristol Stool Chart</h2>

<strong>wait what??</strong>
<p>
I know. I was surprised too. There is a poo chart, it's a real thing. There is even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale">Wikipedia</a> entry, so you know it has to be real! _It is also on WebMD and other sites as well. Including <a href="https://www.continence.org.au/bristol-stool-chart">continence.org</a> which is where the image below comes from.

<p>According the interwebs, the ideal poo is a 3 or 4 on the chart. (<em>Side note:</em> both of them being described as 'like a sausage ... #goVegan.)</p>

<h2> My experience</h2>

<p>Since going to a plant based diet I have been consistently passing a four on the chart. Don't worry - no photos included. (<em>Unless you join my Patreon at the brown level.</em>)</p>

<p>OMG I am totally kidding. I have no Patreon, I have no poop photos. Sorry to disappoint.</p>

<p>For the first two weeks there was A LOT of four.... but four all the same. Ever since it has been a consistent four. It is a joy to poop now. Every morning, consistent consistency, and no real cramping to speak of.</p>

<h2> The downside ?</h2>

<h3> The amount of gas I produce is amazing.</h3>

<p>Seriously, I was <em>not</em> prepared for the amount of gas my stomach started producing on a plant based diet. It is not painful gas, it is not particularly foul smelling, but there is a lot of it. But it has also had benefits.</p>

    <td>I work in an open office area with open cubicles. It is mostly developers or server admins and we are a very quiet bunch. With that in mind I usually like to go for a quick 10 minute walk a few times a day. A few laps around the building certainly is not bad for my overall health, but also a much needed time to release some built up pressure.</td>

  If you see me outside walking, wave at me. When I wave back, know there is a good chance I am farting while I do it. ðŸ˜ˆ </p>
