    <h1>How Being Vegan is Like Building Websites Without Frameworks</h1>

    <p>Choosing a vegan lifestyle and building websites without frameworks might seem like two entirely unrelated things at
    first glance. However, when you dig deeper, you’ll find they share a surprising number of similarities. Both require
    intentionality, creativity, and a deep understanding of what goes into what you’re making.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Here’s why being vegan is like crafting websites from scratch:</h3>
    
    <h4>1. You Know Every Ingredient</h4>
    <p><b>Vegan Life:</b> When you’re vegan, you become an expert label-reader. You carefully check ingredients to ensure everything
    aligns with your values. You know exactly what’s in your food.</p>
    
    
    <p><b>No-Framework Development:</b> When building a website without frameworks, you control every line of code. No bloated
    libraries, no hidden dependencies. You’re aware of every <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, every line of JavaScript, and every CSS rule because you wrote it.</p>
    
    <p><b><em>Lesson:</em></b> Intentionality matters. Knowing what goes into your work—or your meal—ensures it’s aligned with your goals and values.</p>
    
    
    <h4>2. It’s a Little Harder, but That’s the Point</h4>
    
    <p><b>Vegan Life:</b> Finding vegan options isn’t always easy, especially when eating out. You might have to modify recipes or come up with creative substitutions. It can be challenging, but it’s rewarding.</p>
    
    <p><b>No-Framework Development:</b> Building from scratch means no shortcuts. You write your own routing, create custom animations, and implement your own components. It takes more effort upfront, but you end up with lean, optimized, and fully customized code.</p>
    
    <p><b><em>Lesson:</em>The extra effort may seem daunting, but it gives you freedom and control over the final product.</b></p>
    
    <h4>3. You Avoid Unnecessary Bloat</h4>
    
    <p><b>Vegan Life:</b>A vegan diet naturally avoids heavily processed foods, unnecessary additives, and animal products. The result? A cleaner, simpler, and more ethical lifestyle.</p>
    
    <p><b>No-Framework Development:</b> Frameworks can introduce extra weight, unused features, and dependencies. By avoiding them, you’re left with a cleaner, lightweight site that performs exactly how you want it to.</p>
        
    <p><b><em>Lesson:</em></b> Sometimes, simplicity is the best approach.</p>
    
    <h4>4. It Forces You to Learn the Fundamentals</h4>
    
    <p><b>Vegan Life:</b> When you’re vegan, you learn to cook in ways you never thought about before. Want a creamy sauce? Time to master cashews. Need a fluffy dessert? Aquafaba to the rescue! Being vegan pushes you to understand the basics of cooking in a whole new way.</p>
    
    <p><b>No-Framework Development:</b> Skipping frameworks forces you to understand the fundamentals of web development. HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript become your best friends. Mastering three of the most essential tools allows is far easier, in my opinion, then learning a framework. You gain a deeper appreciation for the core technologies that power the web.</p>
    
    <p><b><em>Lesson:</em></b> Mastering the basics empowers you to build better things.</p>
    
    <h4>5. It’s Not for Everyone, and That’s Okay</h4>
    
    <p><b>Vegan Life:</b> Not everyone chooses to go vegan, and that’s fine. It’s a personal decision based on your own values and lifestyle.</p>
    
    <p><b>No-Framework Development:</b> Similarly, not every project needs to be built without frameworks. Sometimes, using React, Svelte, or Vue is the right choice. But if you value control, simplicity, and learning, going framework-free can be incredibly rewarding.</p>
    
    <p><b><em>Lesson:</em></b> There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. Do what works best for you and your goals.</p>
    
    <h4>6. The End Product Feels Better</h4>
    
    <p><b>Vegan Life:</b> When you create a delicious vegan dish, you feel proud knowing it’s healthier, cruelty-free, and aligns with your values.</p>
    
    <p><b>No-Framework Development:</b> When your hand-coded website is fast, accessible, and does exactly what it’s supposed to, you feel the same sense of accomplishment. You built it all yourself—and it shows.</p>
    
    <p><b><em>Lesson:</em></b>Building something from scratch isn’t just about the result; it’s about the journey and the pride you feel when it’s done.</p>
    
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    
    <p>Whether you’re a vegan navigating a world of fast food or a developer avoiding frameworks in a React-dominated ecosystem, both paths require effort,mindfulness, and creativity. But in the end, the process is worth it because it reflects your commitment to doing things your way.</p>
    
    <p>So the next time you’re writing vanilla JavaScript or creating a fully custom CSS grid, remember: you’re not just coding—you’re living a framework-free lifestyle, one intentional decision at a time.</p>
    
    <p>And who knows? Maybe you’ll even celebrate with a homemade vegan treat afterward.</p>
